## Section 6 - User Interface Design

### 6.1 User Interface Design Overview

#### Main Chat Window
- **Components:**
  - **Chat Session List (`chatListView`):**
    - **Type:** ListView
    - **Data Binding:** Binds to the ChatSessions collection, displaying the sessionName for each session.
    - **Interaction:** Selecting an item updates the messageDisplay to show messages from the selected chat session.
    - **Design:** Minimalist design, allowing users to quickly switch between different chat sessions.

  - **Message Display Area (`messageDisplay`):**
    - **Type:** VBox
    - **Data Binding:** Dynamically binds to the Messages collection of the selected ChatSession.
    - **Display:** Formats each Message with the sender's name, timestamp, and text content.
    - **Design:** Clean layout with distinct areas for each message, enhancing readability.

  - **Message Input Area (`messageArea`):**
    - **Type:** TextArea
    - **Data Handling:** Accepts text input from the user.
    - **Interaction:** Users type their messages here; the content is sent upon clicking the sendButton.
    - **Design:** Expansive area to accommodate multi-line text, featuring a simple and intuitive interface.

  - **Send Button (`sendButton`):**
    - **Type:** Button
    - **Action Handling:** Creates a Message object with the content from messageArea and sends it to the current ChatSession.
    - **Interaction:** Ensures messageArea is not empty before sending; clears the area after sending.
    - **Design:** Prominently placed next to the messageArea to facilitate ease of use.

#### User List
- **Components:**
  - **User List (`userList`):**
    - **Type:** ListView
    - **Data Binding:** Binds to the participants of the selected ChatSession, displaying each User's username.
    - **Interaction:** Allows users to initiate private chats or access user profiles from the context menu.
    - **Design:** Streamlined interface that lists users clearly, with indicators for online/offline status.

### Additional UI Elements
- **Notifications:** System notifications for new messages or user activities.
- **User Status Indicator:** A small icon or text near the userâ€™s name in the user list, indicating their online or offline status.
- **Accessibility Features:** Keyboard shortcuts for navigating the chat UI, support for screen readers, and high-contrast themes for users with visual impairments.

### Styling and Theming
- **Color Scheme:** A consistent and soothing color palette that reduces eye strain during extended use.
- **Fonts:** Legible fonts with adjustable sizes to cater to users with different visual preferences.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring a uniform experience across devices.
